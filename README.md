# JSL03 Project Brief: Console-Based Task Manager

My project involves a **simple task management system** where users can add **up to three new tasks** to an existing task array. Tasks are **stored as objects in an array**, each with a **unique incremental ID**. Users will enter task details via prompts, and the system will allow filtering to view only completed tasks. My project focuses on **array manipulation, user interaction via prompts and alerts, and console logging for task management**.
